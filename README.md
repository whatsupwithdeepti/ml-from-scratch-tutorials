# 📘 ML From Scratch Tutorials

A curated collection of Machine Learning tutorials created **from scratch**, combining theory, intuition, math, and hands-on implementation.  
These Jupyter notebooks walk through ML concepts step-by-step — perfect for beginners, students, and anyone who wants to understand ML deeply rather than treating it as a black box.

Created by **Deepti Jethwani**.
